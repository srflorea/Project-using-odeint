This small project uses odeint to solve a simple ODE with interval
arithmetic. Te ODE that is resolved is x' = -x, with x being an
interval. To represent the interval arithmetic I used the 
Boost.Interval library. The program integrates the above ODE starting
from the initial interval x0 = [100, 100.1] for 500 steps with constant
step size dt = 0.01 using Runge-Kutta-4 scheme. The program writes to
the standart output at every timestep the current state. Th output can
be plotted with gnuplot.
In order to compile this little project, it needs the odeint and boost
projects in the same folder with the sources(see Makefile). The odeint
and boost projects folders names have to be 'boost' and 'odeint'.
